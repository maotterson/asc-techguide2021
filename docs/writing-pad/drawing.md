# Writing with the Pen
---

The pen is similar to a mouse in that touching the pad with the pen tip will interact with the laptop via the cursor. It can even be used as a mouse!

To take advantage of the pen features however, we must open some program on the laptop that has some sort of drawing/canvas capability.

## 1. Opening a program to utilize with the pen

There are many different programs that exist that allow for drawing across PCs, Macs, and Chromebooks. On the student laptops good options include Microsoft Word, Sketchpad, and Powerpoint.

## 4. Drawing in other programs

There are other programs that allow drawing, such as Microsoft Paint. Note that Paint was not designed with external pens in mind so the result may not be as smooth as when using Sketchpad.
