# Technology Guide 2021

For our return for Fall Semester 2021 we are introducing two new technologies for tutors to utilize! We hope these tools will be beneficial in offering in-person tutoring while staying in accordance with current social distancing guidelines.

To adjust the **_focus_** of the projector, turn the knob on the **top** of the projector.

> Image20 - LaptopPadConnectedIconImage
> If the student is using a different laptop, particularly a chromebook or mac, there may be a different indication that the device has been successfully connected.

#### 1.3 Setup Review

Image21 - DisplayPadSetupImage
If everything is connected properly, your setup should look something like the image above.

### 2. Drawing with the pen

The pen is similar to a mouse in that touching the pad with the pen tip will interact with the laptop via the cursor. It can even be used as a mouse!
To take advantage of the pen features however, we must open some program on the laptop that has some sort of drawing/canvas capability.

#### 2.1 Opening a program to utilize with the pen

There are many different programs that exist that allow for drawing across PCs, Macs, and Chromebooks. On the student laptops good options include Microsoft Word, Sketchpad, and Powerpoint.

#### 2.2 Drawing in Sketchpad

##### 2.2.1 Opening Sketchpad

Video1 - SketchPadVideo
To open Sketchpad, click the pen icon in the bottom right, then select Sketchpad.

##### 2.2.2 Drawing in Sketchpad

Video2 - Clearing the canvas
There may be a sketch that appears initially. To clear it, press the trash can icon in the top.
Video3 - Drawing with the pen
There are a few different pen tools that can be used for drawing, you can draw on the canvas with any of these selected. Additionally any work done on a canvas can be saved.

#### 2.3 Drawing in Word or Powerpoint

Microsoft Word and Powerpoint also have drawing tools!
On the student laptops, activate the ink tools option by using the pen on the pad.
Image22 - EnableDrawingIcon
Options should appear on the ribbon at the top. Select the pen and draw!
Image23 - DrawWithPenImage

> The drawing may recognize and separate portions into distinct shapes. Some people may find it easier to use Sketchpad for drawing.

#### 2.4 Drawing in other programs

There are other programs that allow drawing, such as Microsoft Paint. Paint may be less desirable than Sketchpad since it doesn't have pressure recognition.
